ORCS: Open Research Communication System

ORCS is an ongoing experiment to address the fundamental challenges that analysts, investigators, and small teams face when storing, organizing, and sharing their own analysis—challenges that are often ignored because they aren't financially profitable to solve.

The current market incentives push towards centralized platforms: "one big place where everyone puts everything." That model is efficient for surveillance and monetization but counterproductive for investigative autonomy and analytical rigor.

What we need instead is:

    A system that enhances the individual analyst’s workflow

    A structure that supports collaborative but local-first analysis

    A format that can scale up in clarity and traceability through a cascading chain of interest (team, organization, oversight)

    And a system that preserves provenance and context across every analytical step

In 2024, I experimented with Obsidian as a potential base for this kind of system. While powerful, it remains frustrating for the average analyst due to its UI assumptions, Markdown reliance, and weak support for structured metadata.

In 2025, I'm building a simplified version of some key features from tools like Obsidian—not to compete, but to extend the core ideas using plain text and URI-based linking instead of Markdown or wikilinks. The result is a system that analysts can see, edit, share, and verify with full transparency—compatible with CSV exports, offline workflows, and human-readable formats.

Feel free to copy any idea from this project.
ORCS exists to empower individual analysts, not to wall off innovation.

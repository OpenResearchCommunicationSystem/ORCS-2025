What Is ORCS?

ORCS is an ongoing experiment to solve the unprofitable problems that matter most to analysts, investigators, and small teams:

    How do you store, organize, and share your own analysis without relying on fragile platforms?

    How do you preserve traceability and context over time?

    How do you collaborate locally while still supporting scalable, structured workflows?


ORCS 2025 experiment

ORCS 2025 takes a .txt approach, a system that allows analysts to share individual cards or export a curated group of cards with an accompanying index via lightweight methods like email, file transfer, or chat, since all data is stored in plain text with embedded metadata. Each card includes rich provenance—citations, classification, entities, and relationships—ensuring analytical integrity and traceability. This empowers individuals to do structured analysis without centralized platforms, while enabling groups or institutions to adopt or enforce standard operating procedures (SOPs) by vetting incoming ORCS files for classification conflicts or errors. Because the format is machine-readable yet human-friendly, it supports both manual workflows and AI-assisted review or model training, allowing knowledge to cascade up from individuals into larger intelligence frameworks without losing context or violating security policy.

ORCS Desktop is designed as a structured, analyst-first tool that supports full import/export of structured data formats like CSV, enabling easy integration with office software, briefing slides, and other analytical tools—all while preserving classification markings, citations, and handling instructions in compliance with standards like ICD 206. It can display link diagrams, auto-match entities across mapped holdings, and trace relationships for rapid reference. By making every extracted insight reusable, traceable, and interoperable, ORCS ensures analysts never have to redo their work, allowing them to cut, paste, and transform prior analysis into new formats or collaborative exchanges with minimal friction—dramatically speeding up the analytical cycle and improving institutional memory.


Why: 

Most tools today push toward centralized platforms—“one big place where everyone puts everything.” That’s great for monetization and control, but terrible for autonomy, clarity, and longevity.

ORCS takes the opposite approach.
What ORCS Stands For

We need systems that:

    Enhance individual workflows

    Support team collaboration without centralization

    Scale up through clear, traceable chains of interest

    Preserve analytical provenance at every step

ORCS is designed for that. It’s not a commercial platform. It’s a pattern. A method. A toolkit you can adapt and see.
Why Not Just Use Obsidian?

In 2024, I explored Obsidian as a base for ORCS. It’s powerful—but too open-ended for many analysts. It assumes a technical user who can build their own workflows from scratch. That’s a barrier.

I still use Obsidian for general notes, but ORCS focuses on a narrower goal:
A system that works by default. One that any analyst can read, share, verify, or fix—even without the original app.
What I’m Building in 2025

This year, I’m prototyping a plain-text, URI-linked version of ORCS:

    No Markdown. No Wikilinks. Just human-readable text and universal references.

    Cards, entities, and relationships—fully exportable to CSV.

    Offline-first and transparent by design.

This system is modeled on real-world success. I once ran intel support for distributed teams, where I controlled both the analysis and the tools. That system worked—and even survived for two years after I left. But when it broke, no one could fix it. It was too complex, and too centralized.

This time, I want something anyone can fix.
What to Expect

I’m not a product team. I don’t have the resources to build a polished app.

Instead, I’ll be posting small, modular ideas throughout 2025:

    Card formats

    Linking models

    Entity/relationship structures

    Offline workflows

    Plaintext + URI-based systems

All of it will be open and public domain. My hope is that someone—maybe you—will take these ideas and use them in something that lasts.
Final Note

ORCS isn’t trying to compete with existing tools.
It’s here to inspire a different way of thinking about research, analysis, and long-term knowledge work.

If you're building tools for serious thinkers—analysts, investigators, researchers—you’re welcome to steal anything from this project. That’s the point.

    ORCS exists to empower individuals, not wall off innovation.
